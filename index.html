    <h1 id="synopsis">About me</h1>
    <p>
 Hello, welcome to my porfolio.  I am Hanitra and I am a aspiring self-taught junion developer </p>

      <h1 id="character">Favorite characters</h1>
      <p>Mirabel, the heroine of the story is the outcast of her family. Despite the fact she is treated differently as a non-special member of the family,she is kind, funny, smart and caring towards her family. She has some struggles that she is trying her best to resolve while helping her family. I love how she is the first Disney heroine to wear glasses. In addition to it, she has curly hair like me. It is easy for me to feel close to this character</p>
        <p>Luisa, the strongest member of the family. I really appreciate several movie members defended the chara-design of Luisa so she will be strong but as well looks strong. Her build body is very relatable and doesn't have any impact on her internal and external beauty. She is a beautiful feminin independant strong woman.However, the picture of her strenght doesn't give her the possibility to fail and she is under a lot of pressure she can't handle. She is caring but she is doing too much and can't really enjoy life because of all her responsibilities in her family and the village. I think we can all relate to the family/society pressure in our life creating a lot of doubts/low self confident etc. Luisa is my favorite character because I can relate to her struggles. By the way, I learn recently that Disney didn't have enough merch for Luisa because Disney thought the other sister, Isabella will be the favorite character of the children because she is described as the perfect member of the family. I am sorry Disney,nowadays children prefer the strong, beautiful and realistic character Luisa.</p>
        <p> Antonio, the youngest one in the family. He is so cute with his curly hair. His heart is so pure, he doesn't treat Mirabelle differently because she doesnt have a gift. He actually has a lot of admiration/love for her. He will ask for Mirabelle support when he is nervous. Later in the movie, he will help Mirabelle in her journey withouth hesitation. In addition to it, I saw a post on Facebook of a 4-year old child who looks so similar to Antonio, he thought they were twins.How wonderful it is that a 4-year old black child can relate to a character in Disney movie. The representation in this movie is just the best.</p>

        <h1 id="song">Favorite song</h1>
             <iframe id ="video" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X-NH1uUfr0U?controls=0&amp;start=152" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

          <p>As we learnt more and more about the family members, we begin to understand the struggle of each character. Luisa is  the strongest in the family. She has a lot of responsibilities in the family and in the village. She is always ready to help to carry everything literally. But she has a lot of self esteem issue and anxiety. She is scared of not being able to meet the expectations of everyone and she doesn't know who she is withouth her strenght but she doesn't show her struggles and continues to carry everything. The song "Surface pressure" is amazing to express her feelings. The song began with very low notes which is very unexpected for a disney woman character but it fit her strength, personnality and her build body so well. She is explaining she knows she is strong and she is capable but under the surface, she is very vulnerable and scared to lose against the pressure of her life. The melody is very pop and I will repeat myself but the song is so relatable for me.</p>

  <h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion </h1>
    <p>I really appreciate the effort to make the environment as realist as possible. Several Columbians artists appreciated the picture of Columbia in the movie. The representation in the movie is as well a big plus while we are used to very ideal princesses and princes; it is refreshing to see on screen more relatable characters as Mirabel, Antonio and Luisa. I only talked about one particular song in this review but the other songs are very representative of Columbia melodies. And I am not very surprised that I enjoy the soundtracks so much because the music composer of the movie is Lin-Manuel Miranda, one of my favorite musical artist. I've basically never been disappointed when I know he is part of the movie production. I love as well how there is no vilain in the story. It is not like a usual fairytales where the hero has to defeat the vilain to save everyone. The main issue in the movie is family struggles and expectations that I think everyone can relate to. I think a important lesson in this movie is you are not your "gift", you are much more than that.</p>
